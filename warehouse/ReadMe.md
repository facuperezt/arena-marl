**Usage** 

Copy gridworld from example_grid to arena-simulation-setup/maps

and specify the path in start_arena_flatland. 

or

Run the launch_file start_arena_gridworld.

pass the number of shelfs in each row/coloumn and also
the number of coloumns in each shelf as arguments and 
run the launchfile (twice - the map generation needs longer 
and the map server takes the old map) 
	
pass bigger_highways as arguments if the non_shelf spaces are to
small for the robots
	
you might need to add a MarkersArray to visualize the Markers
